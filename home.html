                        Naturalization is the process by which U.S. citizenship is granted to a lawful permanent resident
                        after meeting the requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act

                        You can become a U.S. citizen by birth or through 
                        naturalization. Generally, people are born U.S. citizens 
                        if they are born in the United States or if they are 
                        born abroad to U.S. citizens. You may also derive 
                        U.S. citizenship if you were under 18 and a lawful 
                        permanent resident when one or both of your parents 
                        naturalized, or after adoption by a U.S. citizen parent.

                        In general, you may qualify for naturalization if 
                        you are at least 18 years old and have been a 
                        permanent resident for at least 5 years (or 3 years 
                        if you are married to a U.S. citizen) and meet all 
                        other eligibility requirements. You may also qualify 
                        for naturalization based on military service, which 
                        has different requirements.

                        USCIS requires applicants to be fingerprinted 
                        and photographed for the purpose of conducting 
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal

                        be able to re-use fingerprints and photographs 
                        that were previously taken to conduct the required 
                        background checks. You will either receive a 
                        notice that your biometrics have been re-used, or, 
                        if new biometrics are required, you will receive a 
                        notice of a biometrics appointment. All applicants 
                        must have background checks completed before 
                        USCIS will schedule an interview.

                        Once all the preliminary processes on your case 
                        are complete, USCIS will schedule an interview 
                        with you. You must report to the USCIS office at 
                        the date and time on your appointment notice. 
                        Please bring the appointment notice with you. 
                        It is very important not to miss your interview. 
                        If you must miss your interview, follow the 
                        instructions on the appointment notice as soon

                        an interview may add several months to the 
                        naturalization process, so make all attempts
